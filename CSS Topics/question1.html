      <!-- Poem -->
       <p>
        I met a traveller feom an antique land, <br>
        Who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
        Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand, <br>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br>
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed: <br>
        And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br>
        My name is Ozymandias, king of kings; <br>
        Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!" <br>
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
        Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away." <br>
